A- Diagnosing Performance Issues
To diagnose performance issues, follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify the time window.
Step 2: Isolate the largest consumers of database time.
Step 3: Identify the Oracle Application Express workspace and application.
Step 4: Correlate the offending SQL with a specific location within the application.
Once you have identified the slow running pages, you should run the application in debug mode to identify the specific components consuming the most time.
